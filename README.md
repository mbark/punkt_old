# goot (name far from final one)

A tool to manage your dotfiles and your environment.

Project goals:
- Manage dotfiles through simple yet powerful-if-necessary configuration files;
- Provide functionality to easily keep what packages you have installed with package managers up to date and checked in;
- Easily bootstrap a clean system through a standalone binary;
- Reliable and robust, when something fails it should do so with clear error messages;
- Good looking CLI-app that you want to use.
