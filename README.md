# punkt
A tool to manage your dotfiles and your environment.

Project goals:
- Easy to setup a simple initial dotfile repo;
- Easily scale the dotfiles as the config gets more complex;
- Back up what packages to install from which package manager;
- Easily bootstrap a new environment on a clean system;
- Reliable and robust, when something fails it should do so with clear error messages;
- Good looking CLI-app that you want to use.
